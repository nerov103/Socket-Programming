Here are the most important methods specifically for server-side socket programming in Python
===================================================================
1.socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM):

Creates a new socket object, typically using TCP (SOCK_STREAM) for reliable connections.

2.socket.bind((host, port)):

Binds the socket to a specific IP address and port on the server, allowing it to listen for incoming connections on that port.

3.socket.listen(backlog):

Puts the socket into listening mode, accepting incoming connection requests.
The backlog argument specifies the maximum number of pending connections to queue.

4.socket.accept():

Accepts a pending connection request from a client.
Returns a new socket object and the client's address, used for communication with that specific client

5.recv(buffer_size):

Receives data from the connected client socket.
The buffer_size argument specifies the maximum amount of data to receive at a time.

6.send(data):

Sends data back to the connected client socket.

7.close():

Closes the socket, releasing resources and ending the connection.
